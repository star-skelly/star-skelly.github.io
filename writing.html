Here, come with me. It's the 90s. New York City. The goths and punks are wreaking their havoc in music and shows. An ancient vampire drums out a beat while a time-shifting punk screams a song. What could possibly go wrong?<br/>
            <br/>This book to me is a chance to tackle what it means to be lost. Lost in time, lost in yourself, lost in the concept of toughness. It's part of my journey to learn to be soft and kind and gentle, growing up and knowing we're all a little lost and we're all a little weird. But that's what makes us beautiful.</span>

They talked about Atlanta, about the trains, about the friend of a monster they met in the dark. They talked about the fire and the trees, about the family they thought they made in back alleys, about juvie, about everything. Everything except Keane. They couldn't bring themselves to say his name. Brother, home, heartbeat, lost...”<br/><br/>A story about love and family, this one still makes me cry. It follows Asher, a druid of sorts, and the wild west of magical realism and trainhopping across America.</span></div>

<!--
Hi dears, please do not judge the coding of this website too harshly, usually I do backend/ML work... Less experience on the frontend. 
This is my quick lil static site because I wanted to show my work, perhaps you'll see a better implementation some day but for now, do enjoy <3
