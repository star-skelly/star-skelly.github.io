          <h2>THE SOFT MONSTERS: <em>a novel</em></h2>
          <p>This is the novel that most of my brain has been drifting off to on buses and at cafes. It’s the 90s. New York City. The goths and punks are wreaking their havoc in music and shows. An ancient vampire drums out a beat while a time-shifting punk screams a song. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
          <p>This book to me is a chance to tackle what it means to be lost. Lost in time, lost in yourself, lost in the concept of toughness. It’s part of my journey to learn to be soft and kind and gentle, knowing we’re all a little lost and we’re all a little weird. But that’s what makes us beautiful.</p>

          <h2>GNARLED BRANCHES OF THE DEACON TREE: <em>a short story</em></h2>
          <p>“...The jumble found itself curved right into plot line and harmony, a melody strange among the usual cacophony. They talked about Atlanta, about the trains, about the friend of a monster they met in the dark. They talked about the fire and the trees, about the family they thought they made in back alleys, about juvie, about everything. Everything except Keane...”</p>
          <p>This story is about love and family. It follows Asher, a druid of sorts, and the wild west of magical realism and trainhopping across America.</p>

          <h2>SANCTUARY: <em>a poem</em></h2>
          <p>The leaves slither through the dusting of mist, whisper of rain until the sky gives in. Hold tight, hold warm in the rusting greens. Their gentle symphony murmurs that this is safer than any four walls will ever be. No matter how bright, covered in murals and memories, those walls will never hold you like these kind elders will.</p>
          <p>They tilt their heads up in clouds tall, rock you gently to the lullaby of fall. Next to them you are but a living dirt speck, the smallest centipede buried in rotting leaves. Mycelium expands &amp; roots dig deep. Tiny creature, you are held in equal esteem.</p>
